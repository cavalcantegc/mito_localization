Quantitative analysis of mitochondrial spatial localization from fluorescence microscopy images

This repository contains a Python script to quantify mitochondrial localization patterns (perinuclear vs peripheral) in single cells using mitochondria-targeted fluorescence microscopy images.

The method and computational pipeline are described in the accompanying preprint:

# Overview

Mitochondrial positioning is closely linked to cellular metabolism, signaling, and disease phenotypes.  
This script implements an automated image-analysis pipeline that:

1. Segments individual cells
2. Detects mitochondrial signal
3. Computes spatial distribution relative to the nuclear region
4. Classifies mitochondrial localization as perinuclear or peripheral

The pipeline was designed for reproducibility, transparency, and biological interpretability.

# Supported image formats

- `.tif / .tiff`
- `.czi`
- `.lif`

(As long as they contain mitochondria-targeted fluorescence channels.)

# Requirements

The software requirements are summarized in Figure 1 of the manuscript and include the following Python ecosystem:

- Python ≥ 3.8
- NumPy 1.26.4
- SciPy 1.13.1
- scikit-image 0.24.0
- pandas 2.3.3
- matplotlib 3.9.4
- aicsimageio 4.14.0
- aicspylibczi 3.3.1
- tifffile 2023.2.28
- openpyxl 3.1.5

# Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cavalcantegc/mito_localization.git
cd mito_localization

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

pip install numpy scipy scikit-image pandas matplotlib tifffile czifile readlif

# Usage example

python mito_localization.py --file path/to/image.tif --channel 0

# Outputs

The script produces:

- Quantitative metrics of mitochondrial spatial distribution
- Classification of localization pattern (perinuclear vs. peripheral)
- Optional diagnostic plots for segmentation and spatial analysis
- Results are suitable for downstream statistical analysis and figure generation.
